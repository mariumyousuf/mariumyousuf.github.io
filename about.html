		<p class="welcome"> Biography </p>
		<img  src="public/figs/logoheader.png", alt="profile" class="images" style="width: 69%;">
		<p class="webtext"> After graduating from Northern Illinois University with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science, I moved to Tucson, Arizona, for graduate school, where I earned a Master of Science in Computer Science and am now pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics.</p>
		<p class="quotetext">  <i> "It isn't so astonishing, the number of things I can remember, as the number of things I can remember that aren't so." - Mark Twain </i> </p>
		<p class="webtext"> As some who has had an extremely imaginative mind (extremely because I have alwasys felt the urgent need to express my feelings through creative outlets, such as paintings, poems, and prose) the discovery of hwo memory works fascinated me. When writing fictional stories growing up, I often wondered how while some of my characters (and scenes) seemed familiar, others surprised me by their *. </p>
		<p class="webtext"> As an undeclared major, I immediately started looking for avenues to pursue and mix my newfound fascination with my then current academic endeavirs, which eventually lead me to being curious about mathematical investigation of how memory is affected over life time. Hippocampus and refer to the image below. </p>
		<p class="webtext"> During graduate school, also teaching > active learning. active learning environment and how they differ from the traditional lecture-based classroom settings. I hold a great fascination with the work of Carol Dweck, who introduced these two categories of fixed and growth mindset. I grew up with a strict hold on a fixed outlook especially in a school environment (grades received, approach to studying, etc.). I know from my experience it can be difficult to train your mind to think differently and essentially relearn to be an entirely different person. Viewing the learning world with a lense of fixed mindset often led to quick discouragement with lower grades, while after adapting a growth mindset I realized how it highlights the scope of learning together with the progress made so far. It was not until my sophomore year in college that I started to recognize the importance of possessing a growth mindset and the positive attitude it nurtures towards learning. I firmly believe that having a growth mindset is crucial for the honest and long-term success of all students, especially those in STEM fields. Effects of having a growth mindset incorporated into the discussions of active learning really convinced me of the importance of developing it in students.</p>
