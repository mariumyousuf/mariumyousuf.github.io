            About 93% of U.S. adults show anxiety in their comfort-level with mathematics [Blazer, Christie (2011)]

      <h3>Discussion and Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p> 
        <h4> Pre- and Post-Intervention Survey Results </h4>
        Although most students stated MCA is a fair assessment, after exam 1 (before the intervention):
        <ul>
          <li> Most students thought exam questions were tricky and a mix of easy/difficult problems </li>
          <li> Most students also voted for the instructor to go over MCA test-taking strategies </li>
        </ul>
        After the intervention (Strategy 1 and Strategy 2), 
        <ul>
          <li> Multiple students scored higher in Exam 2 than they did in Exam 1</li>
          <li> All students (who responded to the survey) were more careful in reading questions in Exam 2 than they were in Exam 1 </li>
          <li> Majority used the strategy to look for contextual clues to answer problems and attempted the problem first before looking at the option choices </li>
          <li> Majority of responders also stated that they felt more confident taking Exam 2, as compared to Exam 1</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Changes in attitude going from Exam 1 to Exam 2 </h4>

        After the intervention (Strategy 1 and Strategy 2), 

        <ul>
          <li> More students felt happier with their Exam 2 scores</li>
          <li> More students felt their scores were reflective of their math skills after Exam 2 </li>
          <li> Majority felt the instructor provided more opportunities to practice MCA before Exam 2, than before Exam 1 </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Grade distribution </h4>

        <ul>
          <li> The number of A's stayed increasing starting from Exam 1 to Exam 3 </li>
          <li> Class average stayed higer than section-wide averages and medians for Exam 1 and Exam 2 (section-wide statistics unknown for Exam 3, as of May 7th, 2025)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4> Feedback and testimonials after Strategy 3 </h4>

        <ul>
          <li> "I <b> loved the strategies</b> provided on the quiz! It helped <b> jumpstart my thinking</b> in solving the problems. The ones I didnâ€™t know how to do, it was so helpful because it gave me steps or <b> hints in how to start</b> and that reminded me how to do them. I loved that because it was <b> in the format of the exam</b> so if I saw a similar question on the exam it would remind me of the steps provided on the quiz to help me."</li>
          <li> "I like how Marium <b> personalizes the learning process</b> and ask each person in class if they need help. I like how Marium looks over our work and catches mistakes that we might not which helps us fix our mistakes before we go over it together to <b> learn from our mistakes</b>." </li>
          <li> <b> Something that helped me stay motivated is Marium's comments on my exam scores</b>. When I saw them it made me so happy and it made me want to keep working hard ..." </li> 
          <li> I also <b>loved this new approach to get ready for Exam 3</b>. I love that It is replacing our in class quizzes. I feel like pulling out efforts into doing the practice exams is more beneficial and less stressful than in-class quizzes.</li>
          <li> Student on starting late in class: "... Marium's direct, precise, and detailed teaching style made it possible for me to catch up so fast and stay on top of the class." </li>
          <li> "What actually sets her apart is the genuine care and attention she provides. She regularly checks in on each student table by table, ensuring everyone understands the material thoroughly. Her willingness to explain concepts until each student feels confident is truly appreciable." </li>
          <li> "Marium consistently brings numerous examples and practice problems to class. This and <b> the practical methods and valuable tips she shares in class have been extremely helpful during exams</b>. Every time I sat for a test,<b> I found myself recalling her step-by-step instructions, carefully double-checking my work, and confidently solving problems</b>." </li>
          <li> "Thanks to instructor Marium Yousuf dedication and effective teaching methods, I was able to achieve an A (100/100) on my most recent exam. I truly appreciate her support and highly recommend her to anyone aiming for a concrete foundation in math." </li>
        </ul>
      
      <h4> Lessons </h4>
        Since a multiple-choice assessment is not a usual assessment for a math classroom, I highly believe it may help with student performance and confidence if Math 112 instructors emphasized strategies like: looking for context clues, knowing what to do two answer choices seem correct (when to know youâ€™re making an unreasonable assumption to pick an answer choice), obvious but important one is to read the problems diligently, and also to make sure to think about the problem first before looking at the answer choices. 
        <br><br>
        Doing a teaching-as-research project has helped me immensely in formulating how I talk about teaching. I enjoyed applying all that I learned for the CIRTL Associate's certificate to this project. Overall, I felt student liked and appreciated the exam-focused approach I took this semester. That is, designing the quizzes and class activities building up to prepare students for each midterm helped student stay focused on exam preparation.
