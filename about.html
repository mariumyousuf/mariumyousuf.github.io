		<img  src="public/figs/logoheader.png", alt="profile" class="images" style="width: 69%;">
		<p class="webtext"> After graduating from Northern Illinois University with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science, I moved to Tucson, Arizona, for graduate school, where I earned a Master of Science in Computer Science and am now pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics.</p>
		<p class="quotetext">  <i> "It isn't so astonishing, the number of things I can remember, as the number of things I can remember that aren't so." - Mark Twain </i> </p>

		<p class="webtext"> 
			For an undergraduate psychology course, I studied David G. Myers's <i> Exploring Psychology </i> textbook, which introduced me to the intricate workings of our brain. One chapter that particularly stayed with me was on memory. Realizing how our daily experiences are filtered and retained in the brain, and how delicate memory construction actually is, I became eager to learn more about the science of memory.
		</p>
		<p class="webtext">
			As someone with a highly imaginative mind (I say "higly" because I have always expressed my feelings through creative outlets, such as paintings, poems, and prose), I was fascinated by the discovery of how imagination affects memory. When writing fictional stories growing up, I often wondered how my characters came about -- some seemed peculiarly familiar, while others surprised me with their unexpected intellectual depth. I immediately began exploring ways to mix this newfound fascination with my academic interests, which eventually led me to mathematical investigation of memory and the role of the hippocampus (indicated in orange hues in the image below). As per David G. Myers, the hippocampus functions like a "save" button for actively acknowledged memories, and what we remember shapes who we are.

		<p class="webtext">
			During graduate school, I also began exploring the role of memory in learning and became an advocate for active learning environments (as compared to traditional lecture-based classrooms). I closely followed the work of Carol Dweck, who introduced two categories of mindsets: fixed and growth. I grew up with a strong inclination toward a fixed mindset, especially in academics (grades received, approach to studying, etc.). From experience, I know how challenging it can be to train your mind to think differently and essentially "relearn" how to approach life. Viewing learning through the lens of a fixed mindset often led me towards quick discouragement with lower grades. However, after adopting a growth mindset, I became more curious and focused on improving my understanding of challenging concepts. I firmly believe that possessing a growth mindset and nurturing a positive attitude toward learning are crucial for academic success.

			I am an aspiring professor and aim to teach mathematics while fostering growth mindsets in my students. In addition, I aim to contribute to the field of computational neuroscience by conducting deeper research on the role of the hippocampus in memory construction.

For an undergraduate psychology course, I studied David G. Myers's Exploring Psychology textbook that introduced me to the intricate workings of our brain. One of the chapters that stayed with me was on Memory. Realizing how our daily experiences are filtered and retained in the brain and how delicate memory construction actually is, I was eager to learn more about all things memory. As someone with an extremely imaginative mind (I say extremely because I have always urgently expressed my feelings through creative outlets, such as paintings, poems, and prose) the discovery of the effects of imagination on memory fascinated me. When writing fictional stories growing up, I often wondered how my characters came about and how some seemed peculiarly familiar, others surprised me by their non-being intellect. I immediately started exploring avenues to pursue and mix my newfound fascination with my then-current academic endeavors, which eventually led me to the mathematical investigation of memory and the role of the brain region called the hippocampus (indicated in orange hues in the image below). Per David G. Myers, the hippocampus is a "save" button for actively acknowledged memories, and what we remember makes us who we are. During graduate school, I also started exploring the role of memory in learning and became an enthusiast for active learning environments (compared to traditional lecture-based classroom settings). I closely follow the work of Carol Dweck, who introduced two categories of mindsets: fixed and growth. I grew up with a strict hold on a fixed outlook, especially in an academic environment (grades received, approach to studying, etc.). I know from experience it can be challenging to train your mind to think differently and essentially relearn to be an entirely different person. Viewing learning through the lens of a fixed mindset often leads to quick discouragement with lower grades. However, after adopting a growth mindset I was more curious to learn and rectify what was lacking in my understanding. I firmly believe that possessing a growth mindset and the positive attitude it nurtures towards learning is crucial for academic success. I am an aspiring professor and aim to teach mathematics while cultivating growth mindsets in my students, all while contributing to the field of computational neuroscience with deeper research on the role of the hippocampus in memory construction.

I grew up with a strict hold on a fixed outlook especially in an academic environment (grades received, approach to studying, etc.). I know from experience it can be difficult to train your mind to think differently and essentially relearn to be an entirely different person. Viewing learning with a lense of fixed mindset often led to quick discouragement with lower grades, while after adapting a growth mindset I was more curious to learn and rectify what's lacking in my understanding.
